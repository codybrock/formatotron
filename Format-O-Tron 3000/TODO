TODO:

- GUI
	Hopefully the program will be pretty easy to interface with the GUI.
	I honestly just don't know yet. We'll have to see how the tools work first.

- open()
	This method should be a piece of cake:
	Validate the filename
	Read the file, and append each line as a String to inLines
	if anything goes wrong, return an appropriate error message.
	otherwise, return a success message.

- save()
	This one will be a little trickier. It will definitely benefit from some helper functions.
	I think the strategy will be to have a variable for each formatting parameter like:
		int length =  80;
		String align = 'l';
		boolean wrap = false;
		boolean singleSpace = true	// true means single spaced, false means double spaced
		boolean oneCol = true	// true means one column, flase means two columns
	You set the defaults at the beginning of the save() method and then index through the list
	and every time you hit a tag you change the variable and format everything after it.
	For -t, -p# and -b# you just apply it to the next line.
	Have an isTag() method so you can avoid applying formatting to tags. Better yet, a whatTag()
	that returns the name of the tag so you can use it in a switch statement and returns 0
	if it isn't a tag so you know it's content
	The trickiest one is the columns one. I'm not sure this approach would work for that.
